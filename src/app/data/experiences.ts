		summery: "As a Back-end Engineer at Pristine, I've focused on developing and maintaining a scalable, high-performance GraphQL back-end API that powers the application front-end. I work closely with front-end teams to ensure the API seamless integration, which has resulted in an 80% improvement in overall performance. I was in charge of deploying the application back-end services to AWS EC2 server, configured Nginx, and implemented SSL certificates, leveraging Docker and Docker Compose for streamlined containerization and deployment. I also set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, enabling faster deployments and a shorter time-to-market for updates.",
